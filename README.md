## Introduction

This is the course project of CS 399 Moblie Application Development. An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For example, the word anagram can be rearranged into nag a ram, or the word binary into brainy or the word adobe into abode.

This android game has 3 different difficulty levels. The game will provide a word and the player will need to enter the correct anagram in order to continue the game. The length of the word will increase with the difficulty of the game. Once the players finish all questions, the game will show a result page with info like the correct rate.
